2008-08-25 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* Merging tab insert patch from Vivian De Smedt. Removed comments
	  with vds initials.

2008-02-21 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* unicodehelper functions now defaults to ascii if supplied pyreadline_encoding is 
	  not a valid encoding. This is a brute force solution to ticket #228 it fixes 
	  immediate symptom but may not be the correct solution to the underlying problem.
	
2008-01-07 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* Reintroduced code to make pyreadline work with emacs. Not tested.
	  Requested by Frank Wang.

2008-01-04 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* Chunking calls to WriteConsoleW to ensure not exceeding 64k limit

2007-11-28 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* Warning messages for failed calls to parse_and_bind now disabled by default 
	  Can be enabled by call to debug_output("on_nologfile") in pyreadlineconfig.ini

2007-11-20 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* Applying patch from pan to fix flickering cursor problem when doing input
	  of chinese.
	
2007-11-09 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* make all conversion is done by ensure_unicode or ensure_str to ensure uniform
	  handling of unicode issues.

2007-11-09 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* More fixes to unicode handling.

2007-11-09 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* Fixes to make clipboard play nice with unicode. Quick that treats the clipboard as
	  being str with pyreadline_encoding data. Thus convert to unicode when pasting and
	  converting to str when copying.

2007-11-09 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* More fixes to ensure unicode works when completing on filepaths with non ascii symbols. 
	  This fix assumes sys.stdout.encoding is valid for the filesystem. A more correct fix
	  must be applied to the completer code which is outside pyreadline.
	  Any str characters fed into pyreadline should be converted to unicode using 
	  unicode_helper.ensure_unicode.
	* The encoding assumed of strings is sys.stdout.encoding this can be changed by:
	  e.g.  pyreadline.unicode_helper.pyreadline_codepage="utf8"

2007-10-30 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* Fixing console.title to work with wide characters
	* Fixing wide character bug for log_sock

	  history searches for forward_search_history, and reverse_search_history.
	
2007-10-29 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* Patch as provided by pan. Changed ensure_text to decode to 
	  consoles codepage instead of utf8, to ensure proper printing
	  of tab completion of files/directories with non ascii characters
	
2007-07-19 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>

	  pressing ctrl-c.
	
2007-04-18 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* Removing some test methods that should not have been comitted at rev 2246
	
2007-04-17 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* When allowing to bind ctrl-c we now issue a KeyBoardInterrupt if
	  control-c is pressed twice within ctrl_c_tap_time_interval which
	  is defaulted to 0.3 s and can be set from the configfile.
	
2007-04-16 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* doctest imports pdb which imports readline, this means readline
	  can be imported when a dummy object has replaced stdout. The dummy 
	  might miss the encoding property. We now assume stdout.encoding=="ascii" 
	  in this case.
	
2007-04-14 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>

	* Lots of fixes to take care of peculiaritis of System.Console in .NET it does not have 
	  the full windows console functionality. Fill a rectangle is missing, writing without

	  keyboard event checking, endoffile signal to from readline is not using EOFError in ironpython
	  rather returning None
	* Set selectioncolor by looking at foregroundcolor at startup
	* open in ironpython does not ignore unknown letters in mode silently, hade "rt" in history open

2006-01-21  Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>

	* Added clipboard functionality. ctypes clipboard code 
	  borrowed from example code posted to ctypes-users. See
	  http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/ctypes-users/1771866
	* Control-Shift-v moved quoted insert from Control-v
	* Control-v straight paste from clipboard
	* Alt-v ipython_paste. Does some preprocessing of data. If 
	  clipboard text is shorter than 300 characters and has no 
	  newlines and tabs, then assume it is a path and change all 
	  \ to / and then add \ before all spaces. This means you can 
	  paste paths and use them in magic command %cd. If text is 
	  multiline it assumes tabseparated data should be list of 
	  list, if all is numeric assume it should be an array.
	* Control-y yank, alias for Control-v.
	* Control-k kill line, move text from cursor to end of line 
	  into clipboard. Should be move to kill buffer but the kill 
	  buffer is not implemented.
	* Added kill line and yank functionality. As well as mark and 
	  copy-region-to-clipboard.
	* Control-m set-mark sets the copy region mark
	* Control-q copies region between mark and cursor to clipboard
	* Changed version in setup.py to 1.13-svn
	
2006-01-21  Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>

	* Patch to get swedish characters working when python 
	  is executed in a cmd window with codepage set to 1252.
	  Example: issue command chcp 1252. Then change the font to
	  lucida terminal, this is done in the properties dialog of 
	  the terminal.
